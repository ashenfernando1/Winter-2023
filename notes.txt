I want to put in my car for appraisal for a price, then show me cars that I would be interested in 

dont care about engine size, cylinders - fuel capacity, color, mpg_city highway

look at price, mileage, body style 

redduce the set of features for an initial analysis

----------------------

so many different populations buying from carmax
- split into reasonable sub-populations
	- 'upgrade' population - purch price is higher than 
	- loyal to make, own an LTX and buy an LTX
	- sticking to the same body style
	- find a niche 
    
-----------------------

Another division to analyze is the market where the transaction occurred

FOCUSED ANALYSES

- purchased make and appraisal_make are same: BRAND LOYALTY
    - if the brand is same, then what is the difference between the sold car, and the purchased car, in terms of:
        - price
        - mileage
        - body style (trim_descrip)
        - model
- group by market where the transaction occured: MARKET CONSISTENCY
- online and in-person appraisal: 
- trim_descrip going from premium to or not_premium (or vice versa): UPGRADES or DOWNGRADES to lifestyle
